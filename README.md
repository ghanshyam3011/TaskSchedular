# Task Scheduler

A robust command-line task management application written in Java with background task execution capabilities.

## Features
- Create, read, update, and delete tasks
- Store tasks with title, description, and due date
- Command-line interface for task management
- Persistent storage of tasks in JSON format
- Background task execution (even when main application is closed)
- Email notifications for task completion
- Automated task scheduling with custom timing options

```

## Setup and Running

### Basic Setup
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system
2. Compile the application:
   ```
   javac -d classes -cp . src/main/java/com/taskscheduler/*.java
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```
   java -cp classes com.taskscheduler.Main
   ```

### Email Notifications Setup
To enable email notifications:

1. Set your email address in `user-config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "email": "your.email@example.com"
   }
   ```

2. Edit the `run_task_checker.bat` file to add your email credentials:
   ```bat
   set EMAIL_USERNAME=your.email@example.com
   set EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password-here
   ```
   
   Note: For Gmail, you'll need to use an App Password rather than your regular password.
   
3. Email notifications will be sent when tasks are executed by the background scheduler
   }
   ```

2. Configure email credentials in `run_task_checker.bat`:
   ```bat
   set EMAIL_USERNAME=your.email@example.com
   set EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password-here
   ```

3. For Gmail users, you'll need to create an App Password:
   - Go to your Google Account settings
   - Navigate to Security > App passwords
   - Create a new app password for "Mail" and use it as your EMAIL_PASSWORD

## Background Task Execution

This Task Scheduler can run in the background and execute tasks even when the main application is closed. The background execution system consists of:

1. **PowerShell Scheduler (`simple_scheduler.ps1`)**: Runs every minute to check for due tasks
2. **Launcher Script (`start_scheduler.bat`)**: Starts the background scheduler
3. **Task Checker (`run_task_checker.bat`)**: Executes due tasks through the Java application

### Starting the Background Scheduler

To start the background task scheduler:

1. Run the `start_scheduler.bat` file:
   ```
   .\start_scheduler.bat
   ```

2. The scheduler will start in a console window and begin checking for due tasks every minute.
3. You can close the main application, and tasks will continue to execute at their scheduled times.
4. Email notifications will be sent upon task completion (if configured).

### Logs and Monitoring

Background task execution generates several log files:

- `scheduler_log.txt`: Records when the scheduler checks for tasks
- `task_checker_log.txt`: Details about task execution attempts
- `task_outputs/`: Contains output files from executed tasks

## Usage
The application supports the following commands:
- `add` - Add a new task with optional due date and recurrence
- `list` - List all tasks
- `list upcoming` - List upcoming tasks
- `list overdue` - List overdue tasks
- `delete` - Delete a task
- `complete` - Mark a task as completed
- `due` - Set or change the due date for a task
- `tag` - Add tags to a task
- `reminder` - Set a reminder for a task
- `email-notification` - Configure email notifications
- `help` - Show available commands
- `exit` - Exit the application
